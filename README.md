# Design-of-a-Sweep-Generator
Made the Software implementation of a Triangular Sweep Generator on LTSpice, which generated a triangular and sawtooth wave with left and right edges, and the Amplitude of the wave was controlled by the Potentiometer. We also made the Hardware Circuit on the breadboard and verified the output using Digital Storage Oscilloscope.
